 Diversity has become a highly publicised corporate goal, but progress has been slow. As part of our series on [“management’s missing women”](https://www.ft.com/content/a2e41aa4-146c-11e7-80f4-13e067d5072c), we have spoken with executives tasked with building diversity, as well as with women and minorities attempting to advance their careers. Here is a collection of their stories, taken from interviews and FT reader submissions.

 If you would like to include your own thoughts, [share them here](http://financialtimes.polldaddy.com/s/corporate-diversity-2). This feature will be updated with new submissions regularly.
